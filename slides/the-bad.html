  * Many ways to achieve one thing -> suffer from readibility https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/4246qc/heres_why_scala_sucks/
  * Compile time is bad
  * Sill suffer from JVM type erasure
  * Scala is complicated and take time to really master (6 months to reach level A3)
    * Implicit scope search
    * Category theories can be scary
    * Higher kind function is hard to wrap our mind around
